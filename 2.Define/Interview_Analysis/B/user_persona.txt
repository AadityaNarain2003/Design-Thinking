New to college life, B eagerly participates in extracurricular activities, showcasing a preference for a socially active and engaged college experience. He’s accustomed to academic pressure and believes he can handle stress well, claiming that it rarely affects him negatively.

Job-to-be-done:

Pains:

1.Poor Time Management: B struggles with organizing his day, often neglecting important personal habits like maintaining a sleep schedule.
2.Sleep Deprivation: Disregarding sleep and self-care in favor of academic or social activities impacts his long-term well-being, which he may not yet realize.
3.Need for External Motivation: B relies on external consequences or deadlines to drive his productivity, which can lead to last-minute stress.

Gains:

1.Low Stress: B claims that he doesn’t feel stressed, or if he does, it’s more motivational than debilitating. He maintains a confident outlook regarding his academic workload.

Use Case

1.Personal Planner: A structured yet flexible planner could be a valuable tool for B, enabling him to organize his tasks, set priorities, and create self-imposed deadlines before external consequences arise. The planner should encourage him to develop consistency without sacrificing his easygoing approach to stress management.
