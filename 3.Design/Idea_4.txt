Idea:
A gamified self-care game. 
Where the participants are rewarded to take care of themselves.

Problem: The percieved benefit from the gamified model might be less than the academic scores.

AD-LIB:
Here's a value proposition for the Gamified Self-Care Game using the template:

Our Gamified Self-Care Game helps university students who want to improve their personal well-being in a fun and engaging way by reducing the tendency to prioritize academics at the expense of self-care and enabling a sense of reward for small, consistent self-care actions. Unlike traditional academic-focused reward systems, this game reinforces the value of well-being by making self-care tasks enjoyable and incentivizing students to balance personal wellness with academic goals.
