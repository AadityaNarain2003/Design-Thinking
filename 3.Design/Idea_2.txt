IIIT Well-Being Manager:

In our user study we noticed that the user disregards his/her personal well-being. A total neglect in some cases when exams peek, which becomes habitual.
Here personal well being is defined as the quantity of sleep, quality of food, physical exercise, socially spending time with friends, maintaining hygiene and cleaning room/workplace.

Proposed Idea:
1. A notification/widget based mobile app that acts a constant reminder and tries to measure user personal well-being. 
2. It can monitor eating habits, time spend on social media, frequency of using social media and entertainment apps, and serve as a well being reminder.
3. It can be integrated with moodle and serve as a one spot for all academic deadlines.
4. If for example let's say the user is contantly opening Zomato for 4 nights in a row, it reminds the user to eat from the mess. 

User Benefits:
User has a one stop, yes/no based notification system for personal well being. It should be light weight at it's heart and therefore serve as a daily reminder to maintain the less priortised personal well-being.

AD-LIB:
Our IIIT Well-Being Manager helps university students who want to maintain their personal well-being amidst academic pressures by reducing neglect of essential habits and enabling a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. Unlike basic to-do lists or scheduling apps, this lightweight app integrates personalized reminders for well-being activities and academic deadlines, providing a one-stop dashboard to help students manage self-care and coursework more effectively.
