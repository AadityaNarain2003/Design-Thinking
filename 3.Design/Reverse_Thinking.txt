Think:
Steps that a person can take to manage their personal well-being badly.
What all can promote bad personal well-being.

Reverse Thinking:
1. Encourage students to do everything at once
2. Rest is unimportant
3. Ban all extracurricular activities
4. Expect perfection everywhere
5. Let them figure out the balance out on their own
