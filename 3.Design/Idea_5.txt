Idea:
Using IOT and wearables for personal well-being. 

As users might find it difficult to percieve when they feel stressful.
Integration with objects such as smart rings/smart watches where they track heart rate, and 
other such metrics which when analyzed can give us stress level and a lot of other information.
And based on that we can recommend activities to the students.

Unlike standard well-being apps or trackers, this solution integrates with smart rings, watches, and other IoT devices to monitor heart rate and other health metrics, providing students with actionable insights and activities to reduce stress based on real-time data.
