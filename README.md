# Design-Thinking
This is the repository for the course design thinking.

- 0.Step is just the base outline from where we start
- 1.Research is the place where the first divergent component of the Double Diamond starts
- 2.Define is the place where we analyze and understand and converge to reach a How might we statement
- 3.Design phase is where we ideate and try to develop ad-hoc statements and diverge again
- 4.Refine is the last stage of double where we bring back the user and try to find the best solution to the actionable brief.

Process file contains a writeup about my understanding of the Design Thinking approach and process.
