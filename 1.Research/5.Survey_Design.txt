1. Survey Design

Demographics: Include questions about the students' year, specialization, living situation (on-campus/off-campus), and extracurricular involvement.

Academic Stressors: Ask about the main sources of stress (e.g., exams, assignments, project deadlines).

Mental Health and Well-being: Include questions on how students perceive their mental health and well-being, using Likert scales or self-assessment tools.

Time Management: Ask students about their time management strategies, how often they plan and set goals, and their self-efficacy in following through.

Institutional Support: Assess awareness and use of campus resources such as counseling, tutoring, or student wellness programs.

Social Support: Include questions on the availability and importance of social networks (friends, family, peers).

Extracurricular Activities: Ask about participation in clubs, sports, and other activities and their perceived impact on stress and academic performance.

2. Interviews/Focus Groups

In-depth Exploration: Talk to students in focus groups or individual interviews to dig deeper into the impact of stress on their personal lives and academic performance.

Personal Experiences: Capture how different students experience and manage stress, and what coping mechanisms they find effective or ineffective.

Institutional Feedback: Ask for feedback on what more the institution could do to help manage stress, improve academic support, and promote well-being.

3. Observation

Study Habits: Observe students in the library or common study areas to see how they manage time, distractions, and study workloads.

Social Spaces: Observe common areas where students relax or socialize to gauge the balance between academic work and leisure.

4. Analysis Framework

Quantitative Analysis: Use statistical analysis for survey responses, focusing on correlations (e.g., between stress levels and academic performance, stress and institutional support, time management 
effectiveness).

Qualitative Analysis: Analyze interview and focus group data to identify key themes, patterns, and insights about students' experiences.

Comparison with Literature: Relate findings to existing literature on stress, well-being, and time management behaviors.

Expected Output from the above:

1. Key Stressors Identification

Expectation: A clear understanding of the primary factors contributing to academic stress for undergraduate students, such as workload, exams, fear of failure, financial burden, or balancing academics with 
extracurricular activities.

2. Insights into Time Management

Expectation: A better understanding of how effectively students manage their time, whether they use time management strategies, and how this impacts their stress levels and academic performance. You may 
discover that students either lack awareness of effective time management techniques or struggle to follow through with them.

3. Impact of Social and Institutional Support

Expectation: Insights into how much students rely on social support systems (friends, family, peers) and the extent to which they are aware of and utilize institutional support systems like mental health 
services, counseling, or academic resources. You may also learn how these support systems reduce stress or, in their absence, how stress levels increase.

4. Procrastination and Goal Setting

Expectation: Confirmation that students often set goals but fail to follow them through, and that procrastination is a common issue. This will provide insights into their behavior regarding academic tasks and 
goal-setting failures.

5. Extracurricular Activities’ Influence

Expectation: Data on how extracurricular activities affect academic performance and well-being, potentially supporting the literature that suggests a slight positive relationship between participation in 
extracurriculars and academic success.

6. Perception of Well-being and Academic Success

Expectation: A deeper understanding of how academic stress impacts students’ personal well-being (mental and physical health, personal growth) and how this, in turn, affects their academic performance.

7. Student Feedback for Institutional Improvement

Expectation: Direct student feedback on what institutional changes could help alleviate stress, such as enhanced academic advising, improved access to mental health resources, or better time management 
workshops.


8. Practical Solutions and Interventions

Expectation: Recommendations and interventions that can be proposed to the institution or student bodies to address these issues, such as implementing programs focused on time management, mental health 
awareness, and goal-setting support.
