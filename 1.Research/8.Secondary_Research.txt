This is a secondary research to validate some of our finding. The method that we are using for this one is called Simple Observation. 
As the researcher is also a student, he can be considered a participant, some notes might be due to his personal bias. 

Venues for observation: SERC and Workspace at the times of heightened academic pressure, like 2-3 deadlines together or exams.

Workspace: ( UG1/UG2 )
During the time of exams, students mostly spend the night in the workspace itself. They try to minimize their time of sleep, so that they can maximize their time of study. They avoid mess, to avoid walking to the mess,standing in queues and washhing the plates. They would rather order food, so that they can study while eating. Some don't even go to their rooms to freshen up. This practice continues till exams are over( 3 to 5 days ). They don't exercise at all. Therefore, there is a total disregard of their well-being.

During the time of multiple deadlines. The students try to finish the assignments/project/research work during class time, either by missing class physically or mentally. They then use the same pattern as above, that is to disregard personal well-being at all.

SERC: ( UG3+/MS/Ph.D)
The same pattern was observed but with less intensity. People did disregard their personal well-being but not as much. They go to mess, and go to their rooms and freshen up. 


Insights:
Validation of the insights generated from the Surveys and Interviews was acheived.
