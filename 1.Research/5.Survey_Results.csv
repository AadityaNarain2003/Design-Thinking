I don't focus/worry about the outcomes.,"Whether you agree or not, academic stress is brought upon by the student himself. How much ever the institute tries to help, it's upon the student to take action. Apart from that I think the Institution doesn't give much importance to extracurricular activities, which is in my life is extremely crucial to keep myself engaged. No matter How much we try, the college doesn't listen to a word. There is a lack of importance shown for sports from the institute's side which also reflects among the students. No offense to anyone but probably more than half of the students here in IIIT don't engage in any/minimal extracurricular activities, which for me shows the monotonous life here. If they are happy with that, good for them, I'm not judging anyone. But all I see people doing these days is waking up, going for classes, doing their assignments, practicing LeetCode, forcefully going for sports to complete their credits, Scrolling on Instagram, Going to sleep, Repeat. Again I am not saying this is right or wrong/ good or bad. But just think for a second, why would people not develop academic stress, when all they know is that they have to get a well-paying job, maintain a good CG, keep their parents satisfied; while at the same time not having any ambitions of their own. ",It all boils down to how well you can manage your time. ,,

Or I make myself realise that this work doesn't matter at all.,I feel grading is done much more harshly in IIIT. I know it is dependent on professors and nothing can be done but it is what I feel and it is where 99% of my academic stress comes from.,Sleep regularly and maintain physical and mental hygiene.
